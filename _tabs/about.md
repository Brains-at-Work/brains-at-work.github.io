Brains at Work was founded with a mission to increase accessibility to STEM
education by providing tailored, one-on-one, online tutoring sessions in
biology, neuroscience, physics, mathematics, and computer science. With two
neurodivergent individuals at the helm, our teaching approach is informed by
lived experience.

## Purpose and Goals 

Our purpose is to empower students to excel in their academic
pursuits by offering personalised tutoring that fits their individual learning
needs. We aim to make learning engaging, accessible, and effective for all kinds
of brains.


## Our Logo


Our logo comprises the uppercase and lowercase Greek letter gamma, both
of which are coloured with a rainbow gradient based on [Paul
Tol’s](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#fig:scheme_muted) muted
qualitative colour scheme that is designed to be colourblind-friendly. The Greek
letter gamma was chosen as a nod to our respective academic backgrounds. Gamma
represents gamma rhythms in the brain, which are correlates of neural
activation. It also represents the affine connection in General Relativity, and
is the symbol for light, as well as the Lorentz factor.

## Our Team

Our team consists of two experienced educators who are neurodivergent
themselves and are passionate about improving accessibility in academic spaces.
With a diverse background in STEM fields, we are dedicated to helping students
hone their academic and research skills in a rigorous manner that is conducive
to how they learn and experience the world around them.

### Sushi (they/them)


Sushi is a neuroscience student and researcher with a specific interest in pain
perception and chronic illnesses. They received a bachelors degree in Biology
from Ashoka University with a thesis exploring how long term and unpredictable
early life stress affects an organism's behavioral responses to pain. They love
talking about anything biology, and are always eager to learn more. Their
approach to education is a dynamic one, integrating various methods of active
and passive learning.

> From my personal experience with them, they're an extremely curious and
resourceful person, and an exceptional researcher who doesn't shy away from what
they don't understand and works hard to learn whatever is needed to answer a
question posed to them. Interacting with them has given me many opportunities to
understand the messy complexities of biological systems, and has expanded my
view of science from the simple and tractable systems one encounters in physics,
to one where we see endless complexity across various scales in living systems.

Outside of biology, they love to bake delicious cakes and are a skilled and
expressive artist. You can find some of their wonderful art on their Instagram

### Cocoa (she/her) 
{: .right-h3}

Cocoa is a student of physics and an educator with extensive experience in
teaching often intimidating topics in mathematics, physics and computer science
in an intuitive and approachable fashion. Her niche fields are nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. She graduated with a
bachelors degree in Physics from Ashoka University with a thesis exploring
dynamical quantum phase transitions using Monte Carlo methods. Cocoa is
passionate about free and open source software, digital privacy and users
rights, as well as talking anything math and physics. As an educator, she draws
inspiration from STEM education stars such as Grant Sanderson behind
3Blue1Brown, Ben Eater and Professor Philip Moriarty of Sixty Symbols fame,
incorporating interdisciplinary and interactive methods to build strong
foundational knowledge.

> From my time knowing her, Cocoa is a brilliant, empathetic and extremely
> patient teacher who always goes the extra mile for her students to ensure that
> concepts they might struggle with, really sink in. Apart from teaching, she is
> a highly curious and thorough physics researcher, who isn’t afraid of trying
> again after making mistakes, which is the true mark of a scientist. In my
> experience interacting with her, I have gleaned new perspectives and insights
> on topics ranging from fetch, decode and execute cycles, to topics within my
> own field, such as enzyme processivity. Put simply, she is
> [mathematical!](https://youtu.be/FfPFtbJAEm8)

Outside academic settings, Cocoa spends her time playing indie video games,
watching sci-fi TV and obsessing over cartoons.
